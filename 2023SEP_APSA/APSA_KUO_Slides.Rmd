# Introduction

---

class: middle 

# Main Question

- For [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)]((https://rcepsec.org/),
  
  - How much does it cost for a **protective trade policy**?
  
  - i.e., what is the cost for RCEP to block out Taiwan?
  
    - Is **political compromise** costly for a trade bloc?
    


---

class: middle

# Policy Implication
  
- Estimate the cost of **lowering tension** trade policy, by
   
   - Adding shocks in CGE model 
   
   - Simulating the counter-factual outcome

- From a regional integration perspective,

  - How does *RCEP + Taiwan* affect U.S. and China? 
  
  - How would the rest of the world be affected?

# Motivation

- Motivations are coming from three strings of **literature**

  1.  Political Economy 
        - [Murray Weidenbaum (2000). "United States-China-Taiwan: A Precarious Triangle." Challenge, Vol. 43, No. 5, pp. 92-106](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40722032)

  2. Trade 
        - [Autor, David H., David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson. (2013.) "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States." American Economic Review, 103 (6): 2121-68.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121)
        
  3. Computational General Equilibrium Model 
        - [Hertel, T. W. (1997). Global Trade Analysis: Modeling and Applications. United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=DulicT8AAAAJ&citation_for_view=DulicT8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C)

# Conceptual Framework

**Fact 1** 

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> Taiwan has been eager and willing to join RCEP </div>
  
- [New Southbound Policy (2018)](https://www.csis.org/programs/china-power-project/taiwan/new-southbound-policy)  
  
**Fact 2**

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> China blockades Taiwan's role in international community </div>

- [Why Does the WHO Exclude Taiwan? (2020)](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/why-does-who-exclude-taiwan)  

**Assumption**

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> Taiwan's exlcusion to RCEP is due to China's interference</div>

-  [Taiwan, Frozen Out of RCEP, Explores Trade Agreement Options With US (2020)](https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/taiwan-frozen-out-of-rcep-explores-trade-agreement-options-with-us/)

## Contributions

1. Define a term and estimate the **cost** of <span style='font-size:pt; color:pink'>**political compromise**</span>
  <!--- We estimate the <span style='font-size:pt; color:pink'>**opportunity cost**</span> of excluding Taiwan

  - The result can potentially apply to another case in the world --> 

2. Re-evaluate Taiwan's role in US-China geopolitical competition

  <!-- - If Taiwan joins RCEP, will the RCEP, US, or China benefit or hurt? --> 
  
3. The welfare change for the *RCEP+Taiwan* were <span style='font-size:pt; color:pink'>**non-linear**</span>

<!--along with the magnitude of liberalization-->

## Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) 

- The 15 members of the RCEP agreement
  - Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

## Methodology - GTAP Simulation

-   Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)
    -   [GTAP Book (Thomas Hertel, 1997)](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/products/gtap_book.asp)

    -   [GTAP Data Base](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/default.asp)

-   Data
    -   GTAP 10 Databse (2019 release) 

    -   Updated by the GTAP users 

    -   Constructed by each country's Input-Output (I-O) Tables

-   Model 
    - [The Standard GTAP Model, Version 7](https://jgea.org/ojs/index.php/jgea/article/view/47)
    
    - Multiple markets (sectors x regions x factor) working at once
    
    - Using computers to solve high-dimensional GE model

# GTAP System

# Data - GTAP Database Version 10

![gtapdb1.png](gtapdb1.png)
- Version 10 was released in 2018 by Center for Global Trade Analysis
- In GTAP 10 
  - Sector, N = 65, Country, N = 141, Production Factors, N = 5
  - So we basically solving a 65 x 141 x 5 model everytime

# CES Nested Production

A 'firm' is a series of CES production functions

  - Top level

    - optimally (min cost) combine value added and intermediate aggregate

  - 2nd level

    - Value added nest: Optimally (min cost) combine value-added inputs

    - Intermediate nest: Optimally (min cost) combine intermediate inputs

# Result of Taiwan Joins RCEP - 1

- First we tablet to EV after the experimental shocks

# Result of Taiwan Joins RCEP - 2

- Then we switch to $\Delta$GDP after the experimental shocks

# Conclusion

1. Define a _new term_, **placating cost**, and estimate it.
  - It's costly to lower the tension.
  - We focus on the case of Taiwan-RCEP case
  - We apply the widely-used Computational GE Model
  - We apply the updated dataset with lastest sector-level I-O tables 
    
3. Show RCEP is a _good option_ for Taiwan.
  -  It's cliché, but we show quantitative estimation here 
  - **limitation** (banned goods across the straights)

4. Provide _anothor explanation_ of current equilibrium
  - Taiwan's exclusion is not due to pure politics.
  - Economic benefits skew to Taiwan asymmetrically.
  - Neither due to pure economics, nor pure politics.

# Future Work

1. Apply **heterogeneous shocks** to different production sectors 

  - Cross reference to the updated tariff reduction schedule
    
2. Explore more possible shocks in trade. 
  
  - i.e., like **blockade** or military drills
  
  - This is on the horizon with Anton Yang.
    
3. Expand the analysis to exam future PTAs, or review the exisiting one. 

  - i.e., CPTPP, U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade.
