# Introduction

---

class: 

## Main Questions

- Could we identify the <u>process</u> of Taiwan building the world's PC manufacturing center?

--

- How do we measure the <u>role</u> of the industry in global trade?

  - **degree of centrality** in the trade network

--

- Could we demonstrate the <u>evolution</u> by using International Trade Network analysis?

--

- Is Taiwan still in <u>center</u> of the global trade network now?

## Contributions

  - Develop an algorithm to analyze Taiwan's role in global trade graphically.
    - It does <u>not</u> limit to PC industry; the algorithm potentially could expand to other industries. 
  
  - Demonstrate the <u>evolution</u> of the centrality of the Taiwan-PC industry.

# International Trade Network

- International trade data can be analyzed using a network perspective, where the network is a set of countries linked by weighted and directed trade ties. 

--

- International Trade Network (ITN) has various name, aka
  
  - World Trade Web (WTW)
  
  - World Trade Network (WTN)

--

- To build up the network in the International Trade setting, we need some of the attributes. 
  
  - Region 
  - Income Level
  - GDP
  - GDP per capita 
  - GDP growth
  - FDI

# Network  

- M.O. Jackson (2008) - Social and Economic Networks

- Nodes and Players 

 - The set $N=\{1,...,n\}$ is the _nodes_ that are involved in a network of relationships.
 
 - Sometimes ones refer it "vertices," "individuals," "agents," or "players."
 
 - In the international trade network, the nodes we have here are "countries."
 
- ITN is a "directed" network 
 
  - A network is _directed_ if it is possible that $g_{ij} \neq g_{ji}$ for all nodes $i$ and $j$.
 
- Degree and Network Density
  
  - _Degree_ of a node is the number of links that the node gets involved, which is the cardinality of the node's neighborhood. The node i's degree in a network g, denoted $d_i(g)$, is 
  
  $d_i(g) =  #{j: g_{ji}=1} = # N_i(g)$
---

# Network (cont.)
- Micro Perspective 
  
  - Measures of centrality can be categorized into four main groups depending on the types of statistics on which they are based. 

  - Centrality: 
      
      1. Degree: how connected a node is. (**which we focus in this project**)
    
      2. Closeness: how easily a node can reach other nodes.
    
      3. Betweenness: how important a node is in terms of connecting other nodes.
      
      4. Neighbors' Characteristics: how important, central, or influential a node's neighbors are. 
      
- Macro Perspective
  
  - Degree Distribution and Network Density

# Conclusion


- By comparing the five year span network graphs: there are two major conclusions we can draw. 

  1. From the plotted out results, we found the     "centrality" for of the PC-manufacturing industry

  2.

# Future Work

1. Expand this to the other industries, and compare the PC industry to other industries in the trade liberalization era. 

2. Expand the current exercise to a macro-perspective, try to find out the _density of the network_ and the _degree of distribution_

3. Connect the results to the dynamic Computational General Equilibrium model.
