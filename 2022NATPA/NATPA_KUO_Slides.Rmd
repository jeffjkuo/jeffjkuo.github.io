# Introduction

-   Main Question
    
    -   If Taiwan joins [RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership)](https://rcepsec.org/), how does it affect China, the U.S., and the rest of world?

-   Relating Literature

# Taiwan's Role?

1.   Taiwan's Role?
    -   If Taiwan joins RCEP, will the U.S. hurt? Will China benefit?
    
    -   If Taiwan is invited to join RCEP, should we discontinue ECFA?
    
2.   Contributions
    -   We single out Taiwan, China, and the U.S.
    
    -   Analyze the Preferential Trade Agreements that Taiwan got involved

# Data and Model: GTAP

-   Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)
    -   [GTAP Book (Thomas Hertel, 1997)](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/products/gtap_book.asp)

    -   [GTAP Data Base](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/default.asp)

-   Data
    -   GTAP users upload each country's Input-Output (I-O) Tables

-   CGE Model
    -   General Equilibrium (Walrasian Equilibrium)
        -   Definition
        -   How supply and demand interact and tend toward a balance in an economy of multiple markets working at once.
        
    -   CGE: **C**omputational **G**eneral **E**quilibrium
        -  Using computers to solve GE
        -   We use the default model in the GTAP

# Conclusion & Future Work & Thank You

-   Primary Conclusions

    1.   RCEP might be a good option for Taiwan.
    
    2.   Taiwan is blocked, not because of pure politcal reasons.
    
    3.   But if the U.S. was excluded, the U.S. will hurt the most.

-   Future Work
    -   Apply Heterogeneous Shocks in different production sectors.
    -   Explore more possible shocks in policy tools.
    -   Expand the analysis to see the synergy of multiple PTAs, i.e., CPTPP and EFCA.

-   Thank You!
    -   It's really nice to see you, and welcome to D.C.!
