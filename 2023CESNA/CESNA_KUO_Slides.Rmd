# Introduction

---

class:middle 

# Main Question

- For a trade bloc like RCEP,
  - How much does it cost for a **protective trade policy**?
  - i.e., blocking out a strong economic entity

- Policy Implication: 
  - Is **political compromise** costly for the trade bloc?

- From Taiwan's perspective,
  - How does [RCEP](https://rcepsec.org/)+Taiwan affect U.S.-China **co-opetition**? 
  - How would the rest of the world be affected?

# Motivation

- Motivations are coming from two strings of **literature**...

  1.  Precarious Triangle (2000)
        -   [Murray Weidenbaum 2000. "United States-China-Taiwan: A Precarious Triangle." Challenge, Vol. 43, No. 5, pp. 92-106](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40722032)

  2. China Syndrome (2010)
        -   [Autor, David H., David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson. 2013. "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States." American Economic Review, 103 (6): 2121-68.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121)
        
- How about connecting those two topics with the CGE model?      
  - 1 + 2 + CGE

# Assumption

**Assumption 1** 

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> Taiwan has been eager and willing to join RCEP </div>
  
- [New Southbound Policy (_CSIS China Power Project Report_, 2018)](https://www.csis.org/programs/china-power-project/taiwan/new-southbound-policy)  
  
**Assumption 2**

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> China blockades Taiwan's role in international community </div>

- [Why Does the WHO Exclude Taiwan? (_Council on Foreign Relations_, 2020)](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/why-does-who-exclude-taiwan)  

**Assumption 3**

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> Taiwan's exlcusion to RCEP is due to China's interference</div>

-  [Taiwan, Frozen Out of RCEP, Explores Trade Agreement Options With US (_The Diplomat_, 2020)](https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/taiwan-frozen-out-of-rcep-explores-trade-agreement-options-with-us/)

## Contribution

1. Define a term and estimate the **cost** of <span style='font-size:pt; color:pink'>**political compromise**</span>
  - We estimate the <span style='font-size:pt; color:pink'>**opportunity cost**</span> of excluding Taiwan

  - The result can potentially apply to another case in the world

2. Re-evaluate Taiwan's role in US-China geopolitical competition

  - If Taiwan joins RCEP, will the RCEP, US, or China benefit or hurt?
  
3. The benefit and the loss for the counterparts involved were 
  - <span style='font-size:pt; color:pink'>**non-linear**</span>, along with the magnitude of liberalization

<!-- # Model  -->
<!-- GTAP Overview - Production - Consumption - Price - Open Economy -->

## Main Methodology - GTAP Simulation

-   Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)
    -   [GTAP Book (Thomas Hertel, 1997)](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/products/gtap_book.asp)

    -   [GTAP Data Base](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/default.asp)

-   Data
    -   GTAP users upload each country's Input-Output (I-O) Tables

-   CGE = **C**omputational **G**eneral **E**quilibrium
    - How supply and demand strike a balance in an economy 
    
    - Multiple markets (sectors x regions x factor) working at once
    
    - Using computers to solve high-dimensional GE model
    
    - We use the default model in the GTAP

---

# GTAP System

![GTAP System](gtapflow.png){width=100%}

# Data - GTAP Database Version 10

![gtapdb1.png](gtapdb1.png)
- Version 10 was released in 2018 by Center for Global Trade Analysis
- In GTAP 10 
  - Sector, N = 65, Country, N = 141, Production Factors, N = 5
  - So we basically solving a 65 x 141 x 5 model everytime

# Result of Taiwan Joins RCEP - 1

- First we tablet to EV after the experimental shocks

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap= 'Welfare Change in Experimental Shocks'}
knitr::include_graphics("EVchange.png")
```

# Result of Taiwan Joins RCEP - 2

- Then we switch to $\Delta$GDP after the experimental shocks

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap= 'GDP Growth Rate in Experimental Shocks'}
knitr::include_graphics("GDPchange.png")
```

# Conclusion

1. Define a _new term_, **placating cost**, and estimate it 
  - We focus on the case of Taiwan-RCEP-China case
  - We apply the widely-used Computational GE Model
  - We apply the updated dataset with lastest sector-level I-O tables 
    
3. Show RCEP is a _good option_ for Taiwan.
  -  It's cliché, but we show quantitative estimation here 
  - **limitation** (banned goods across the straights)

4. Provide _anothor explanation_ of current equilibrium
  - Taiwan's exclusion is not due to pure politics
  - Economic benefits skew to Taiwan asymmetrically 
  - Neither due to pure economics (this is still hard to prove it)

# Future Work

1. Apply **heterogeneous shocks** to different production sectors 

  - Cross reference to the updated tariff reduction schedule
    
2. Explore more possible shocks in trade. 
  
  - i.e., like **blockade** or military drills
  
  - This is on the horizon with Anton Yang.
    
3. Expand the analysis to exam future PTAs, or review the exisiting one. 

  - i.e., CPTPP, U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade.
