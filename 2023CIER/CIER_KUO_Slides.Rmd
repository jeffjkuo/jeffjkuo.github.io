# 1. Introduction


Research Question - Motivation - Assumption - Contribution - RCEP
---

class:middle 

# Research Question

- For a trade bloc like RCEP
  - How much does it cost for a protective trade policy? 
  - i.e., blocking out a good economic entity

- From Taiwan's perspective
  - If Taiwan joins [RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership)](https://rcepsec.org/), how does it affect China, the U.S., and the rest of the world?

---
class: middle

# Motivation

- Motivations are coming from two strings of **literature**...

  1.  Precarious Triangle (2000\~)
        -   [Murray Weidenbaum 2000. "United States-China-Taiwan: A Precarious Triangle." Challenge, Vol. 43, No. 5, pp. 92-106](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40722032)

  2. China Syndrome (2010\~)
        -   [Autor, David H., David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson. 2013. "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States." American Economic Review, 103 (6): 2121-68.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121)
        
- How about connecting those two topics with the CGE model?      
  - 1 + 2 + CGE

# Assumption

- Assumption 1

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> Taiwan has been eager and willing to join RCEP </div>
  
$\hspace{0em} \checkmark$  [New Southbound Policy (_CSIS China Power Project Report_, 2018)](https://www.csis.org/programs/china-power-project/taiwan/new-southbound-policy)  
  
- Assumption 2

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> China blockades Taiwan's role in international community </div>

$\hspace{0em} \checkmark$  [Why Does the WHO Exclude Taiwan? (_Council on Foreign Relations_, 2020)](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/why-does-who-exclude-taiwan)  

- Assumption 3 

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> Taiwan's exlcusion to RCEP is due to China's interference</div>

$\hspace{0em} \checkmark$  [Taiwan, Frozen Out of RCEP, Explores Trade Agreement Options With US <br> (_The Diplomat_, 2020)](https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/taiwan-frozen-out-of-rcep-explores-trade-agreement-options-with-us/)

## Contribution

1. Estimate the **Cost** of **Political Compromise**

  - How much is the potential loss of the RCEP for **NOT** letting Taiwan in? 
  
2. Re-evaluate Taiwan's Role in US-China competition, _Counter-factually_ 

  - If Taiwan joins RCEP, will the U.S. hurt? Will China benefit?
  
  - <span style='font-size:pt; color:pink'> although we know it is impossible...</span>

3.The benefit and the loss for the countries involved were <span style='font-size:pt; color:#FF5733'>**not linear**</span>, along with the magnitude of trade liberalization

# Methodology 
 a.k.a. Literature Review (in this talk)

## GTAP 

-   Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)
    -   [GTAP Book (Thomas Hertel, 1997)](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/products/gtap_book.asp)

    -   [GTAP Data Base](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/default.asp)

-   Data
    -   GTAP users upload each country's Input-Output (I-O) Tables

-   CGE Model
    -   General Equilibrium (Walrasian Equilibrium)
        - Definition
        - How supply and demand interact and tend toward a balance in an economy of multiple markets working at once.
        
    -   CGE: **C**omputational **G**eneral **E**quilibrium
        -  Using computers to solve GE
        -  We use the default model in the GTAP

# Data

# Data 

 
![gtapdb1.png](gtapdb1.png)
- In GTAP 10 
  - Number of Sector, N = 65
  - Number of Country, N = 141
  - Number of Production Factors, N = 5
  - So we basically solving a 65 x 141 x 5 model everytime.

# Conclusions
-   Primary Conclusions
    1. RCEP might be a good option for Taiwan.
    
    2. Taiwan is blocked, not because of pure politcal reasons.
    
    3. But if the U.S. was excluded, the U.S. will hurt the most.

-   Future Work
    1. Apply Heterogeneous Shocks in different production sectors.
    
    2. Explore more possible shocks in policy tools.
    
    3. Expand the analysis to see the synergy of multiple PTAs, i.e., CPTPP and EFCA.
