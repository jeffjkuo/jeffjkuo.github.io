# Introduction - Main Questions

- From the World's perspective
  - How much does it cost for a protective trade policy? 
  - i.e. blocking out a good economic entity

- From Taiwan's perspective
  - If Taiwan joins [RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership)](https://rcepsec.org/), how does it affect China, the U.S., and the rest of world?

- Some Relating Literature

    1.  Precarious Triangle (2000\~)
        -   [Murray Weidenbaum 2000. "United States-China-Taiwan: A Precarious Triangle." Challenge, Vol. 43, No. 5, pp. 92-106](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40722032)

    2.  China Syndrome (2010\~)
        -   [Autor, David H., David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson. 2013. "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States." American Economic Review, 103 (6): 2121-68.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121)

# Introduction - Contribution(s) 


1. Estimate the **Cost** of **Political Compromise**

  - How much is the potential loss of the RCEP for **NOT** letting Taiwan in? 
  
2. Re-evaluate Taiwan's Role in US-China competition, _Counter-factually_ 

    - If Taiwan joins RCEP, will the U.S. hurt? Will China benefit?

# Data and Model: GTAP

-   Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)
    -   [GTAP Book (Thomas Hertel, 1997)](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/products/gtap_book.asp)

    -   [GTAP Data Base](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/default.asp)

-   Data
    -   GTAP users upload each country's Input-Output (I-O) Tables

-   CGE Model
    -   General Equilibrium (Walrasian Equilibrium)
        - Definition
        - How supply and demand interact and tend toward a balance in an economy of multiple markets working at once.
        
    -   CGE: **C**omputational **G**eneral **E**quilibrium
        -  Using computers to solve GE
        -  We use the default model in the GTAP

# Result of Taiwan Joins RCEP - 2

# Conclusions

-   Primary Conclusions
    1. RCEP might be a good option for Taiwan.
    
    2. Taiwan is blocked, not because of pure politcal reasons.
    
    3. But if the U.S. was excluded, the U.S. will hurt the most.

-   Future Work
    1. Apply Heterogeneous Shocks in different production sectors.
    
    2. Explore more possible shocks in policy tools.
    
    3. Expand the analysis to see the synergy of multiple PTAs, i.e., CPTPP and EFCA.
