# Introduction


Research Question - Motivation - Assumption - Contribution - RCEP
---

class:middle 

# Research Question

- For a trade bloc like RCEP,
  - How much does it cost for a **protective trade policy**?
  - i.e., blocking out a strong economic entity

- Policy Implication: 
  - Is **political compromise** costly for the trade bloc?

- From Taiwan's perspective,
  -  How does [RCEP](https://rcepsec.org/)+Taiwan affect U.S.-China **co-opetition**? 
  - How would the rest of the world be affected?

---
class: middle

# Motivation

- Motivations are coming from two strings of **literature**...

  1.  Precarious Triangle (2000\~)
        -   [Murray Weidenbaum 2000. "United States-China-Taiwan: A Precarious Triangle." Challenge, Vol. 43, No. 5, pp. 92-106](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40722032)

  2. China Syndrome (2010\~)
        -   [Autor, David H., David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson. 2013. "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States." American Economic Review, 103 (6): 2121-68.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121)
        
- How about connecting those two topics with the CGE model?      
  - 1 + 2 + CGE

# Assumption

- Assumption 1

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> Taiwan has been eager and willing to join RCEP </div>
  
$\hspace{0em} \checkmark$  [New Southbound Policy (_CSIS China Power Project Report_, 2018)](https://www.csis.org/programs/china-power-project/taiwan/new-southbound-policy)  
  
- Assumption 2

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> China blockades Taiwan's role in international community </div>

$\hspace{0em} \checkmark$  [Why Does the WHO Exclude Taiwan? (_Council on Foreign Relations_, 2020)](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/why-does-who-exclude-taiwan)  

- Assumption 3 

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green; text-align: center"> Taiwan's exlcusion to RCEP is due to China's interference</div>

$\hspace{0em} \checkmark$  [Taiwan, Frozen Out of RCEP, Explores Trade Agreement Options With US <br> (_The Diplomat_, 2020)](https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/taiwan-frozen-out-of-rcep-explores-trade-agreement-options-with-us/)

## Contribution

1. Estimate the **Cost** of **Political Compromise**

  - How much is the potential loss of the RCEP for **NOT** letting Taiwan in? 
  
2. Re-evaluate Taiwan's Role in US-China competition, _Counter-factually_ 

  - If Taiwan joins RCEP, will the U.S. hurt? Will China benefit?
  
  - <span style='font-size:pt; color:pink'> although we know it is impossible...</span>

3.The benefit and the loss for the countries involved were <span style='font-size:pt; color:#FF5733'>**not linear**</span>, along with the magnitude of trade liberalization

# Methodology 
 a.k.a. Literature Review (in this talk)

---

## GTAP 

-   Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)
    -   [GTAP Book (Thomas Hertel, 1997)](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/products/gtap_book.asp)

    -   [GTAP Data Base](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/default.asp)

-   Data
    -   GTAP users upload each country's Input-Output (I-O) Tables

-   CGE Model
    -   General Equilibrium (Walrasian Equilibrium)
        - Definition
        - How supply and demand interact and tend toward a balance in an economy of multiple markets working at once.
        
    -   CGE: **C**omputational **G**eneral **E**quilibrium
        -  Using computers to solve GE
        -  We use the default model in the GTAP

# Data 

 
![gtapdb1.png](gtapdb1.png)
- In GTAP 10 
  - Number of Sector, N = 65
  - Number of Country, N = 141
  - Number of Production Factors, N = 5
  - So we basically solving a 65 x 141 x 5 model everytime.

# Conclusion

-   Primary Conclusions
    1. Define a **new term,** and use the case of Taiwan-RCEP-China case to estimate. 
    
    2. Show RCEP is a good option for Taiwan. 
      - <small> It's cliché, but we show quantitative proof here. </small>
    
    3. Current equilibrium is not due to pure politics, of course, neither due to pure economics. 
      - <small> Economic benefits skew to Taiwan asymmetrically. </small>

class: middle, left
# Future Work

1. Apply **heterogeneous shocks** to different production sectors 

  - Cross reference to the updated tariff reduction schedule
    
2. Explore more possible shocks in trade. 
  
  - i.e., like **blockade** or military drills
  
  - This is on the horizon with Anton Yang.
    
3. Expand the analysis to exam future PTAs, or review the exisiting one. 

  - i.e., CPTPP, U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade.
